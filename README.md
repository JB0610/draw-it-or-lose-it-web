## Reflection Questions
1. **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements:** The Gaming Room, a gaming company specializing in mobile applications, wanted to transition their game "Draw It or Lose It" from Android to a web-based platform. They sought a versatile web application that maintains core mechanics and enhances accessibility.

2. **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?** In developing this documentation, we effectively communicated the project's scope, requirements, and recommendations. We provided a comprehensive overview covering various aspects of the software design process.

3. **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?** Working through the design document helped provide clarity on the project's architecture, requirements, and constraints. It served as a roadmap for development, guiding decision-making and ensuring alignment with client expectations.

4. **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?** One area for potential revision could be providing more detailed information on specific technologies or frameworks to be used in the development process. This could enhance clarity and provide developers with more specific guidance.

5. **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?** User needs were interpreted through considerations such as scalability, cross-platform compatibility, and usability. Incorporating these into the software design ensures that the final product meets user expectations and provides a satisfactory gaming experience.

6. **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?** Our approach involved thorough analysis of requirements, identification of constraints, and thoughtful consideration of system architecture. In the future, we would continue to employ similar techniques, focusing on iterative design and incorporating user feedback to continuously improve the software.
